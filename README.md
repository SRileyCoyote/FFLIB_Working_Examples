# FFLIB Working Examples

## Overview

This Repo Shows working examples of the FFLIB architechure design patterns using design patterns and best practices I have picked up over the years. This is an open source repo intended for my own personal use and to share with those that need it. 

Below you will find:
- [Setup Instructions](#scratch-org-setup-instructions) on how to create a Scratch Org and populate it with all of the metadata included for the org as well as some Example Test Data so that you can see how the examples work in a live environment.
- [Use Cases](#example-use-cases) for all of the code provided in this Repository as well as a brief overview of the coding method examples are included in that Use Case.
- [Links for More Information](#links-for-more-information) about the Application Schema as well as each of the different FFLIB Layers, both official definitions as well as notes about my own understanding of how each Layer is works with each other.

Already Included in the Metadata are copies of the following Repos:
- [FFLIB Common](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/FFLIB_COMMON)
- [FFLIB Mocks](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/APEX_MOCKS) 
- [SObjectFabricator](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/SOBJECT_FABRICATOR)

Did I missed the mark on something? <br>
Do you still have questions about how to do something? <br>
Are the examples or comments not clear enough for what you are trying to do?

I consider this Example Repo as still a Work In Progress and would love to hear any feedback on what you think is still missing, what is not correct, or could be done better or more efficiently. 

Please feel free to leave a comment in the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/SRileyCoyote/FFLIB_Working_Examples/discussions). 

## Scratch Org Setup Instructions

1. Download Repository to Local Machine with VS Code (or similiar IDE)
   1. Ensure [latest Salesforce CLI is installed](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm) for `SF` Commands
1. Connect IDE to DevHub Enabled Org (Org Alias: DevHub)
1. Create Scratch Org from DevHub 
```
sf org create scratch -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a MyScratchOrg -d -v DevHub -y 30
```
4. Deploy all Metadata to Scratch Org
```
sf project deploy start -d force-app -o MyScratchOrg -c
```
5. Assign Permission Set to User
```
sf org assign permset -n BoardGamePS -o MyScratchOrg
```
6. Populate Data Using Plan
```
sf data import tree -p ./data/Import-plan.json
```

## Example Use Cases

For this example, I put together an Application in Salesforce based on what I know best: Board Games and Board Game Conventions.

[Apex Classes](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples) are all sorted and organized in seperate folders based on the their respective layers. 

In this example, we will be using the following Use Cases:
1. [Mark Board Game as Favorite](#1-mark-as-board-game-as-favorite)
1. [Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API](#2-import-board-game-list-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API](#3-update-individual-board-game-information-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Check Out/In Board Game (WIP)](#4-check-outin-board-game-wip)
1. [Home Board Game Dashboard (WIP)](#6-home-board-game-dashboard-wip)

### 1. Mark as Board Game as Favorite

As an Event Attendee, when I add a Board Game Rating that is Marked as Favorite, I would like all of the other Board Game Ratings marked as Favorite for that Attendee to be Unchecked.
If Multiple Board Game Ratings are added for Attendee where Favorite is Checked, Display Error to Attendee.

This Use Case shows examples for the following:
- Trigger using SObjectDomain as TriggerHandler
- Using Custom Metadata Types to Configure:
    - Trigger Handler
    - Serivce Methods
- Implementing Interfaces
- Extending Base Parent Class
     - Overriding Abstract and Virtual Methods
     - Using Protected Access Modifier
- FFLIB
    - Application Layer
    - Trigger Handler 
    - Domain Layer
    - Service Layer
    - Selector Layer
    - Unit Of Work Layer
- Testing
     - MockSetup Class
     - Mocking and Stubbing FFLIB
     - Use Case Unit Testing

### 2. Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like a form to import my Collection or GeekList from BoardGameGeek and add new those new Board Games into the application. 
Any Board Games not already in the application I would like marked as ðŸ†• and for those games to automatically be added to the Board Game Library for the Event I selected. 
Upon follow up imports, I would like the option to update the existing Board Games information as well as the Board Game Library Entry from BoardGameGeek and for the Board Game to no longer be marked as ðŸ†•.

This Use Case shows examples for the following:
- LWC
     - Import Apex Controller
     - Toast Messaging
     - Wire Connection
     - Promise Connection
     - Populate Combobox from Records
- REST API Callouts
     - HTTP Callout Setup
     - Parsing XML Results
- Wrapper Classes
- Implementing Interfaces
- Extending Base Parent Classes
     - Overriding Abstract and Virtual Methods
     - Using Protected Access Modifier
- FFLIB
     - Application Layor
     - Implementation Layer (APEX Controller)
     - Service Layor
     - Selector Layor
     - Unit Of Work Layer
- Testing
     - Mocking and Stubbing FFLIB Classes
          - [Mocks.Verify() Examples](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/README.md#mocksverify-example-quick-reference)
     - Use Case Unit Testing
     - Mock Http Callouts
          - Using Static Resources for XML Results

**To use Importer:** 
- Open Board Games App, 
- Click Board Game Importer Tab. 
- Select Default Event (My Event)
- Enter Collection Name or GeekList ID:
     - Collection Name Example: __AZ933K__[^1]
     - GeekList ID Example:     __347463__

[^1]: NOTE: The first time a Collection is requested from BoardGameGeek after a long period of time, it will be queued resulting in an error. If this happens just re-click submit and try again.

### 3. Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like to be able to click on a button to update individual board game's information from BoardGameGeek. I would like to be able to do this from the Board Game Record as well as the Board Game Library Entry Record, the latter of which would also update the Comments for the Entry. I would also like to be able to do this from the List View for each of these Objects and be able to Select Multiple Records to be Updated at once.

#### (TODO):
```
1. Add Headless Action to BG Library Entry
     - Update Comment on BG Library Entry as well
2. Add Headless Action to Board Game List View
3. Add Headless Action to BG Library Entry List View
```

### 4. Check Out/In Board Game (WIP)

As an Event Attendee, I would like to click a button and automatically Check Out a Board Game from the Board Game Library. I would like this option to only be available if there is a copy of the Board Game Available to Check Out. I would also like to be able to view the Board Games that are checked out and click a button from the Check Out Log Record or List View that will check that Board Game back in.

### 6. Home Board Game Dashboard (WIP)

As an Event Owner, I would like to see a Dashboard showing: 
- Total number of Board Games for the Event 
- How many Board Games have been Checked Out
- How many Board Games are Currently Checked Out
     - How long they have been checked out for
     - If they have been checked out for longer than the average Duration for the Game
