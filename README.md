# FFLIB Working Examples

## Overview

This Repo Shows working examples of the FFLIB architechure design patterns using design patterns and best practices I have picked up over the years. This is an open source repo intended for my own personal use and to share with those that need it. 

Below you will find:
- [Setup Instructions](#scratch-org-setup-instructions) on how to create a Scratch Org and populate it with all of the metadata included for the org as well as some Example Test Data so that you can see how the examples work in a live environment.
- [Use Cases](#example-use-cases) for all of the code provided in this Repository as well as a brief overview of the coding method examples are included in that Use Case.
- [Links for More Information](#links-for-more-information) about the Application Schema as well as each of the different FFLIB Layers, both official definitions as well as notes about my own understanding of how each Layer is works with each other.

Already Included in the Metadata are copies of the following Repos:
- [FFLIB Common](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/FFLIB_COMMON)
- [FFLIB Mocks](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/APEX_MOCKS) 
- [SObjectFabricator](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Common%20Classes/SOBJECT_FABRICATOR)

Did I missed the mark on something? <br>
Do you still have questions about how to do something? <br>
Are the examples or comments not clear enough for what you are trying to do?

I consider this Example Repo as still a Work In Progress and would love to hear any feedback on what you think is still missing, what is not correct, or could be done better or more efficiently. 

Please feel free to leave a comment in the [Discussions Tab](https://github.com/SRileyCoyote/FFLIB_Working_Examples/discussions). 

## Scratch Org Setup Instructions

1. Download Repository to Local Machine with VS Code (or similiar IDE)
   1. Ensure [latest Salesforce CLI is installed](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm) for `SF` Commands
1. Connect IDE to DevHub Enabled Org (Org Alias: DevHub)
1. Create Scratch Org from DevHub 
```
sf org create scratch -f config/project-scratch-def.json -a MyScratchOrg -d -v DevHub -y 30
```
4. Deploy all Metadata to Scratch Org
```
sf project deploy start -d force-app -o MyScratchOrg -c
```
5. Assign Permission Set to User
```
sf org assign permset -n BoardGamePS -o MyScratchOrg
```
6. Populate Data Using Plan
```
sf data import tree -p ./data/Import-plan.json
```

## Example Use Cases

For this example, I put together an Application in Salesforce based on what I know best: Board Games and Board Game Conventions.

[Apex Classes](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples) are all sorted and organized in seperate folders based on the their respective layers. 

In this example, we will be using the following Use Cases:
1. [Mark Board Game as Favorite](#1-mark-as-board-game-as-favorite)
1. [Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API](#2-import-board-game-list-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API](#3-update-individual-board-game-information-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Check Out/In Board Game (WIP)](#4-check-outin-board-game-wip)
1. [Home Board Game Dashboard (WIP)](#6-home-board-game-dashboard-wip)

### 1. Mark as Board Game as Favorite

As an Event Attendee, when I add a Board Game Rating that is Marked as Favorite, I would like all of the other Board Game Ratings marked as Favorite for that Attendee to be Unchecked.
If Multiple Board Game Ratings are added for Attendee where Favorite is Checked, Display Error to Attendee.

We will use the following to implement this Use Case: 
- Create [Trigger](/force-app/main/default/triggers/BoardGameRatingsTrigger.trigger) using SObjectDomain as TriggerHandler
     - Which Calls Created [Trigger Handler](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/BoardGameRatingsTriggerHandler.cls) extending [Base Trigger Handler](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/BaseTriggerHandler.cls)
          - Which Uses Created [Custom MDT](/force-app/main/default/customMetadata/Domain_Config.BoardGameRatings.md-meta.xml) to Enable and Disable Trigger
          - And Calls Created [Board Game Rating Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGameRatingsService.cls) extending [Base Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BaseService.cls) and implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/Interfaces/IBoardGameRatingsService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
               - Which Uses Created [Custom MDT](/force-app/main/default/customMetadata/Services_Config.setNewFavorite.md-meta.xml) to Enable and Disable Features
               - And Calls Created [Board Game Rating Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BoardGameRatingSelector.cls) and implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Interfaces/IBoardGameRatingSelector.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
               - And Created [Board Game Rating Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) extending [Base Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BaseDomain.cls) and implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Interfaces/IBoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) which extends [Base Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Interfaces/IBaseDomain.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
- Test Classes
     - Create [Trigger Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/Tests/Trigger%20Tests/BoardGameRatingTriggerTest.cls)
     - Create [Trigger Handler Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/Tests/BoardGameRatingsTriggerHandlerTest.cls) mocks [Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGameRatingsService.cls) when called by [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create [Service Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/Tests/BoardGameRatingsServiceTest.cls) mocks [Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) and [Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BoardGameRatingSelector.cls) when called by [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create [Domain Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Tests/BoardGameRatingsDomainTest.cls) 
     - Create [Base Domain Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Tests/BaseDomainTest.cls)
     - Create [Selector Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Tests/BoardGameRatingSelectorTest.cls)

### 2. Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like a form to import my Collection or GeekList from BoardGameGeek and add new those new Board Games into the application. 
Any Board Games not already in the application I would like marked as ðŸ†• and for those games to automatically be added to the Board Game Library for the Event I selected. 
Upon follow up imports, I would like the option to update the existing Board Games information as well as the Board Game Library Entry from BoardGameGeek and for the Board Game to no longer be marked as ðŸ†•.

We will use the following to implement this Use Case:
- Create [Lightning Web Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/boardGameImporter/boardGameImporter.js)
     - Which Calls Created [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/BoardGameImporterController.cls)
          - Which Calls Created [Event Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/EventSelector.cls) implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Interfaces/IEventSelector.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
          - And Calls Created [Board Game Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGamesService.cls) extending [Base Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BaseService.cls) implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/Interfaces/IBoardGamesService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
               - Which Uses Created [Custom MDT](/force-app/main/default/customMetadata/Services_Config.getBoardGameDetailsFromBGG.md-meta.xml) to Enable and Disable Features
               - And Calls Created [Board Game Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BoardGameSelector.cls) implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Interfaces/IBoardGameSelector.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
               - And Calls Created [Board Game Library Entry Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BGLibraryEntrySelector.cls) implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Interfaces/IBGLibraryEntrySelector.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)

### 3. Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like to be able to click on a button to update individual board game's information from BoardGameGeek. I would like to be able to do this from the Board Game Record as well as the Board Game Library Entry Record, the latter of which would also update the Comments for the Entry. I would also like to be able to do this from the List View[^2] for each of these Objects and be able to Select Multiple Records to be Updated at once.

[^2]: LWC Headless Actions are not currently Available for List View Buttons. Attempted several workarounds using URL buttons linking to Aura, Flow, VF Pages to show the results in a pop-up modal with little to no success. Settled on just using a Flow with an Invocable Action that opens in a new Screen and redirects back to the List View When Done.

We will use the following to implement this Use Case:
- Two Headless Lightning Web Components
     - Create One for [Board Game](/force-app/main/default/lwc/updateGameFromBGG/updateGameFromBGG.js)
          - Which Calls Created [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/UpdateFromBGGController.cls)
               - And Calls Updated [Board Game Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGamesService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
                    - Which Uses Created [Custom MDT](/force-app/main/default/customMetadata/Services_Config.updateBoardGameDetailsFromBGG.md-meta.xml) to Enable and Disable Features
                    - Which Calls Updated [BoardGameGeek Callout Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BGGCalloutService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create One for [Board Game Library Entry](/force-app/main/default/lwc/updateCollectionFromBGG/updateCollectionFromBGG.js)
          - Which Calls Same [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/UpdateFromBGGController.cls)

     - Create One for [Board Game](/force-app/main/default/flows/UpdateRecordFromBGG.flow-meta.xml)
          - Which Calls Created [Invocable Action](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/FlowUpdateBoardGameFromBGGController.cls)
               - Which Reuses Same Method in [Board Game Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGamesService.cls) as LWC
     - One for [Board Game Library Entry](/force-app/main/default/flows/UpdateBGLEFromBGG.flow-meta.xml)
          - Which Calls Created [Invocable Action](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/FlowUpdateBGLEFromBGGController.cls)

### 4. Check Out/In Board Game (WIP)

As an Event Attendee, I would like to click a button and automatically Check Out a Board Game from the Board Game Library. I would like this option to only be available if there is a copy of the Board Game Available to Check Out. I would also like to be able to view the Board Games that are checked out and click a button from the Check Out Log Record or List View that will check that Board Game back in.
