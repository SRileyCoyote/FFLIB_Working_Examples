# Example Use Cases

In order to best showcase all of the coding examples i have learned over the years, I put together an Application in Salesforce based on what I know best: Board Games and Board Game Conventions.
This app started simply enough but has since expanded a bit with more and more functionality. In order to bring order to the chaos, I have listed out here the different Use Cases I have put together for this App.

For each Use Case, I will do my best to describe the Scope of the Use Case, how it was implemented, and what examples it showcases. 

[Apex Classes](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples) are all sorted and organized in seperate folders based on the their respective layers.

SObject Schema can be found [here](/documentation/SObject-Schema.md).

In this example, we will be using the following Use Cases:
1. [Mark Board Game as Favorite](#1-mark-as-board-game-as-favorite)
1. [Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API](#2-import-board-game-list-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API](#3-update-individual-board-game-information-from-boardgamegeek-api)
1. [Check Out/In Board Game](#4-check-outin-board-game)
1. [Home Board Game Dashboard (WIP)](#5-home-board-game-dashboard-wip)

## 1. Mark as Board Game as Favorite

As an Event Attendee, when I add a Board Game Rating that is Marked as Favorite, I would like all of the other Board Game Ratings marked as Favorite for that Attendee to be Unchecked.
If Multiple Board Game Ratings are added for Attendee where Favorite is Checked, Display Error to Attendee.

We will use the following to implement this Use Case: 
- Create [Trigger](/force-app/main/default/triggers/BoardGameRatingsTrigger.trigger) using SObjectDomain as TriggerHandler
     - Which Calls Created [Trigger Handler](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/BoardGameRatingsTriggerHandler.cls) extending [Base Trigger Handler](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/BaseTriggerHandler.cls) overriding After Insert and After Update
          - Which Uses Created [Custom MDT](/force-app/main/default/customMetadata/Domain_Config.BoardGameRatings.md-meta.xml) to Enable and Disable Trigger
          - And Calls Created [Board Game Rating Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGameRatingsService.cls) extending [Base Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BaseService.cls) and implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/Interfaces/IBoardGameRatingsService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)

               - And Created [Board Game Rating Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) extending [Base Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BaseDomain.cls) and implementing [Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Interfaces/IBoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) which extends [Base Interface](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Interfaces/IBaseDomain.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
- Test Classes
     - Create [Trigger Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/Tests/Trigger%20Tests/BoardGameRatingTriggerTest.cls)
     - Create [Trigger Handler Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/Tests/BoardGameRatingsTriggerHandlerTest.cls) mocks [Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGameRatingsService.cls) when called by [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create [Service Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/Tests/BoardGameRatingsServiceTest.cls) mocks [Domain](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/BoardGameRatingsDomain.cls) and [Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BoardGameRatingSelector.cls) when called by [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create [Domain Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Tests/BoardGameRatingsDomainTest.cls) 
     - Create [Base Domain Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Domains/Tests/BaseDomainTest.cls)
     - Create [Selector Test Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/Tests/BoardGameRatingSelectorTest.cls)

## 2. Import Board Game List from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like a form to import my Collection or GeekList from BoardGameGeek and add new those new Board Games into the application. 
Any Board Games not already in the application I would like marked as ðŸ†• and for those games to automatically be added to the Board Game Library for the Event I selected. 
Upon follow up imports, I would like the option to update the existing Board Games information as well as the Board Game Library Entry from BoardGameGeek and for the Board Game to no longer be marked as ðŸ†•.

TODO:
```
- When Importer Runs, Add Library Entries to Event if not found when Update NOT Selected
- Update Success Message to include number of Library entries created
- Add Button Remove Collection From Event That Deletes BGLE for that Collection for the Event
- Remove Game From Library When Removed From Collection or GeekList
- If Collection Not Found, Return Error.
```

## 3. Update Individual Board Game Information from BoardGameGeek API

As an Event Owner, I would like to be able to click on a button to update individual board game's information from BoardGameGeek. I would like to be able to do this from the Board Game Record as well as the Board Game Library Entry Record, the latter of which would also update the Comments for the Entry. I would also like to be able to do this from the List View[^2] for each of these Objects and be able to Select Multiple Records to be Updated at once.

[^2]: LWC Headless Actions are not currently Available for List View Buttons. Attempted several workarounds using URL buttons linking to Aura, Flow, VF Pages to show the results in a pop-up modal with little to no success. Settled on just using a Flow with an Invocable Action that opens in a new Screen and redirects back to the List View When Done.

We will use the following to implement this Use Case:
- Two Headless Lightning Web Components
     - Create One for [Board Game](/force-app/main/default/lwc/updateGameFromBGG/updateGameFromBGG.js)
          - Which Calls Created [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/UpdateFromBGGController.cls)
               - And Calls Updated [Board Game Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BoardGamesService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)

                    - Which Calls Updated [BoardGameGeek Callout Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BGGCalloutService.cls) and is Instantiated through [Application](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Application/Application.cls)
     - Create One for [Board Game Library Entry](/force-app/main/default/lwc/updateCollectionFromBGG/updateCollectionFromBGG.js)
          - Which Calls Same [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/UpdateFromBGGController.cls)

## 4. Check Out/In Board Game

As an Event Runner, I would like to click a button and automatically Check Out a Board Game from the Board Game Library. I would like this option to only be available if there is a copy of the Board Game Available to Check Out. If a Copy of the Board is already checked out, I would also like to see a Button to Check the Board Game In. 
I would like this functionality to be available throughout the app and available on any record page that displays a board game (i.e. Board Games, Library Entries, Check Out Logs, Ratings, etc.)

In order to accomplish this, we will create a Flow for each SObject Type that will support the functionaility. On each Flow, we will add a Lightning Web Component that can be added to a Flow Screen and will accept Input Properties so that the LWC Component will be configurable and resuable across all of the SObject Flows. We will also utilize a [Custom Property Editor (CPE)](/force-app/main/default/lwc/README.md#what-are-cpes) LWC on the Flow Screens for a cleaner UI for entering the inputs for the LWC on the Screen Flow.  

We will use the following to implement this Use Case:

- Create Screen Flow for Each SObject
     - Which has a Screen with a [Parent Container Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/checkOutLogContainer)
          - Which calls the [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/checkOutLogController.cls)
               - Which calls the correct Selector based on SObject Type:
                    - [Board Game Library Entry Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BGLibraryEntrySelector.cls)
                    - [Check Out Log Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BGCheckOutLogSelector.cls)
                    - [Board Game Rating Selector](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Selectors/BoardGameRatingSelector.cls)
          - Which will include a [Check Out Button Child Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/checkOutGame)
               - Which calls the [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/checkOutLogController.cls)
                    - Which calls to [Check Out Log Service Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BGCheckOutLogService.cls) to Create the Check Out Log 
          - And also includes a [Check In Button Child Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/checkInGame)
               - Which calls the [Apex Controller](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Controllers/checkOutLogController.cls)
                    - Which calls to [Check Out Log Service Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BGCheckOutLogService.cls) to Update the Check Out Log 
          - Which uses a [CPE Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/cpeCheckOutLogConfig) to format the Properties of the Component
               - Which includes a [Child Component](/force-app/main/default/lwc/cpeLogButtonConfig) for the Properties for each of the Buttons
- Add the Screen Flow to Record Pages for Respective SObjects
- Create a [Trigger](/force-app/main/default/triggers/BoardGameCheckOutLogTrigger.trigger) on Check Out Log
     - Which calls the [Trigger Handler](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/TriggerHandlers/BoardGameCheckOutLogTriggerHandler.cls)
          - Which calls the [Service](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/Services/BGCheckOutLogService.cls) that will populate a Hidden Field for Rollup Calculations

This Use Case shows examples for the following:
- Screen Flows
- LWC
     - Import Apex Controller
     - Toast Messaging
     - Wire Connection to get Records from Controller
     - Utilize Refresh Apex
     - Nested Child LWCs
          - Passing Values to Child
          - Firing Custom Events
          - Catching Events Fired from Child
     - Using Properties
     - Using CPE for Properties
- FFLIB
     - Application Layer
     - Implementation Layer (APEX Controller and Trigger Handler)
     - Service Layer
     - Selector Layer
     - Unit Of Work Layer
- Testing
     - Mocking and Stubbing FFLIB Classes
          - Using [MockSetup Class](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/README.md#mock-setup-class)
          - Validate Using [Mocks.Verify](/force-app/main/default/classes/FFLIB%20Examples/README.md#mocksverify-example-quick-reference)
     - Use Case Unit Testing
